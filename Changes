	- Like an idiot i forgot to change the version number
	  from version 0.01 to 0.02 and because of CPAN's security
	  restriction about uploading files with a duplicate name
	  I have to up the version number.

    - I feel this module is ready for serious use. I have been
	  using it in production environments for almost 2 years now,
	  and I have recently beefed up the test suite as well. It now
	  has 371 tests with approx. 95% code coverage. I feel the code
	  is solid as is the API (although some people dont like my 
	  Java-esque naming style, but hey whatta ya do). Most of this
	  release is just tweaking and fine tuning of code, and updating
	  of the documentation.
